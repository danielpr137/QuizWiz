## QuizWiz File Upload Functionality Branch
In this branch of the QuizWiz project, we are meticulously developing the front-end interface pertaining to the file upload feature. The primary objective is to enable users to seamlessly submit their academic text files, which will serve as the foundation for our system's subsequent question and answer generation processes.

Each contribution to this branch should ensure that the user experience remains intuitive and robust, while maintaining the highest levels of data security and integrity. It is imperative for contributors to adhere to the stipulated coding standards and guidelines, ensuring that the upload functionality is not only efficient but also seamlessly integrates with the core functionalities of the QuizWiz system.
